# Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 2
This is the second project that I have submitted to the **Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree** by **Udacity**. It consists of a **memory game** made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Process
With the [fend-project-memory-game](https://www.linkedin.com/in/txago/ "fend-project-memory-game") starter code in hands, I have a helpful kick off base to set my development strategy and start building my game incrementally.
