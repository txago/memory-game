# Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 2
This is the second project that I have submitted to the **Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree** by **Udacity**. It consists of a **memory game** made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I have baptized it as "Social Networking Game", in which the user needs to match social network logos.

## Process
With the [fend-project-memory-game](https://www.linkedin.com/in/txago/ "fend-project-memory-game") starter code in hands, I had a helpful kick off base to set my development strategy and start building my game incrementally.

As I went through the .js file instructions and based myself on the material provided by the Udacity Nanodegree course and Mozilla documentation, I mostly used event phases, listeners and delegation; manipulation of element methods and properties, as well as some CSS customisation.
